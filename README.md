I'm a high school junior who is interested in computer science! I'm currently learning computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and I work on personal projects or hackathons in my free time. I also write robot code for [BadgerBOTS FRC Team 1306](https://github.com/team1306) 🦡

## What I'm working on
- 📃 Uploading my notes from school to Github
- 🚧 Creating a website
- 🤖 Coding a swerve drive for my robotics team!
