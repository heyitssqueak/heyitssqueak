I'm a high school junior who is interested in computer science! I'm currently learning Java at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and I work on personal projects or hackathons in my free time. I also write robot code for [BadgerBOTS FRC Team 1306](https://github.com/team1306) 🦡

## What I'm working on
- 📃 Uploading my Markdown notes to GitHub
- 🥇 Practicing for USACO
- 🚧 Demonstration of what I currently know in Java
- 🐸
